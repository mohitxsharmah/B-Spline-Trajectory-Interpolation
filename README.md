This project explores how smooth and continuous motion paths can be generated using B-Spline and Polynomial interpolation in MATLAB.
It focuses on maintaining position, velocity, acceleration, and jerk continuity, which are key for applications like robotics and motion control systems.

I worked on this during my Research Internship at NIT Bhopal (June–July 2025) under the guidance of Dr. C. M. Krishna.
It was a great learning experience that helped me understand trajectory design, optimization, and the balance between flexibility and computational efficiency.
